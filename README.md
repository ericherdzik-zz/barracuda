# Barracuda

This is a work in progress. More details coming soon...

## Mission Statement

The purpose of this project is to:
1. Provide a simple and repeatable pattern for provisioning multi-GPU Linux hosts with common set of runtime dependencies for executing crypto-currency mining applications.
2. Establish a common pattern and interface, i.e. via Docker images, that enables the deployment and execution of mining applications at scale efficiently and reliably.
